# üß† Black‚ÄìLitterman Portfolio Optimizer + Monte Carlo Simulation

This project implements a **complete end-to-end portfolio optimization workflow** using the **Black‚ÄìLitterman model** combined with **Monte Carlo simulation** to visualize and analyze before/after results.

The system:
1. Reads your portfolio (`stocks.xlsx`)  
2. Generates an optimized allocation using the Black‚ÄìLitterman model  
3. Updates your Excel sheet with whole-share targets  
4. Runs a Monte Carlo simulation to compare **risk & return** before and after optimization  
5. Visualizes the two simulations side by side

## Part 2 of Project:
1. Pulls the top fortune 500 companies through a webscrapper
2. Uses the one hour time frame for the past six months for the prices
3. Calculates the entropy with the Shannon Entropy Model
4. Saves the calculated stocks entropy to a sql database

   ## To-Do's
   Running a diagnositc on a given stock
      Determine whether the stock is moving due to a momentum(trend) or mean-reversion
   Create a strategy and backtest it

## üíº Portfolio Composition (Example)
Below is an example set of tickers and their role in a diversified portfolio:

| Ticker | Company / Sector | Typical Role in Portfolio |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **AAPL** | Apple Inc. | Large-cap tech growth, strong innovation pipeline |
| **AMZN** | Amazon.com Inc. | E-commerce & cloud (AWS) diversification |
| **JPM** | JPMorgan Chase & Co. | Financial sector exposure (banking stability & dividends) |
| **KO** | Coca-Cola Co. | Consumer defensive stock for stability & yield |
| **META** | Meta Platforms Inc. | Communication services & AI expansion |
| **MSFT** | Microsoft Corp. | Cloud, AI, and productivity software leader |
| **PLTR** | Palantir Technologies | High-growth data analytics & AI sector exposure |
| **SPY** | S&P 500 ETF | Broad U.S. market exposure and diversification anchor |
| **T** | AT&T Inc. | Telecommunications income & dividend stability |
| **UPS** | United Parcel Service | Logistics & transport sector diversification |
| **XOM** | Exxon Mobil Corp. | Energy & commodities exposure for inflation hedge |

This balanced selection provides exposure across **tech, finance, consumer, industrials, energy, and telecom**, which helps control overall volatility.

## üß© How It Works
1. Black‚ÄìLitterman Optimization (optimization.py)
Uses PyPortfolioOpt to compute a market equilibrium prior.
Instead of handcrafted subjective absolute views, this repo derives absolute views programmatically from 1-year percentage returns scaled by volatility. This yields data-driven, normalized views: View_i = (1-year return_i) / volatility_i
Views are clipped (e.g., between ‚àí0.3 and 0.3) for stability.

3. Portfolio Update (updatePortfolio.py)
Converts optimized weights into whole-share allocations using current prices from Yahoo Finance.
Uses a largest-remainder style approach to spend leftover cash fairly and keep total allocated value ‚âà original portfolio value.
Writes a new sheet BL_Allocation with exactly:
Tickers | Shares

5. Monte Carlo Simulation (monteCarlo.py)
Simulates thousands of correlated return paths using the covariance structure from historical returns.
Uses actual share counts (from the Excel sheet) to compute starting market-value weights and the initial portfolio value.
Returns expected final return and risk (std) and the simulated paths for visualization.

7. Visualization (main.py)
Orchestrates the workflow and shows a single figure with two side-by-side plots: Monte Carlo paths before and after optimization (normalized to start = 1).
